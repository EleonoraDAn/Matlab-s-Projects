This repository contains two projects developed for an exam. The first project focuses on optimization and root-finding techniques, including methods for locating minima and maxima using "fminbnd", Fibonacci search, and Golden Section search. It also covers methods for finding the roots of functions using Newton's method, the Bisection method, and the Secant method, as well as finding fixed points using "fzero".

The second project delves into interpolation and approximation methods. It includes Lagrange interpolation, node generation with the Chebyshev method, and the use of spline functions. The project also explores parametric function interpolation, error analysis with Chebyshev errors, and the interpolation of points obtained via ginput. Additionally, it covers approximation techniques such as least squares fitting, and numerical integration methods like the Trapezoidal and Simpson's rules.

The language used for both projects is Italian.
